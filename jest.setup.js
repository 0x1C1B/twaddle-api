 * Paths in which to search for environment files.

 * Basically, environment files are searched for in the current working directory and in
 * the 'resouces' folder in the project directory.
 *
 * The order of the paths is essential, the environment files are read in this order.
 * Environment files that are already set and appear again in a later file are not set
 * again. That is, values of higher-ordered paths have higher priority and "override"
 * values of lower-ordered paths.
